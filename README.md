MindfulSpace is a full-stack wellness platform designed to help users cultivate mindfulness, track daily habits, and engage with motivational content. It features motivational popups, emoji-based check-ins, daily task tracking, and AI-powered reflections, all wrapped in a modular, responsive interface. The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, while the backend (planned) will use Node.js and Express, with MySQL as the database and JWT-based authentication for secure access. The project also integrates an AI layer for personalized insights. The folder structure includes organized components like Navbar, MotivationalPopup, EmojiCheckin, and DailyTasks, along with pages for login, dashboard, and home. Setup involves cloning the repository, installing dependencies, configuring environment variables, and running the development server. Testing is in progress, with unit and integration tests planned. The roadmap includes completed frontend scaffolding, authentication, and core features, with upcoming goals like backend API integration, AI journaling assistant, and gamified wellness challenges. Contributions are welcome, and the project is licensed under MIT.
